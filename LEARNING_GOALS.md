# Learning Goals

## Primary Objective

Build a complete mobile application from scratch to learn **transferable software engineering skills** — not just specific frameworks.

## What I Want to Learn

### Architecture & Design

- Making informed architectural decisions and understanding trade-offs
- Structuring a codebase that scales without over-engineering
- Separating concerns (UI, state, business logic, external services)

### Full Stack Understanding

- How mobile apps work end-to-end
- Client-server communication patterns
- Authentication flows (OAuth)
- Local storage and state management

### Decision-Making

- Evaluating options without researching everything myself (time-prohibitive)
- Understanding _why_ certain patterns exist, not just _how_ to use them
- Recognizing when "simple" beats "clever"

## What I Don't Care About

- Mastering specific languages or frameworks for their own sake
- Memorizing APIs — I can look those up
- Following trends — I want fundamentals

## Guiding Principles

1. **Transferable over specific** — Choose options that teach concepts applicable elsewhere
2. **Understand before using** — No copy-paste; know why each piece exists
3. **Build to use** — This should be a real app I actually use, not a tutorial project

## Success Looks Like

- I can explain every architectural choice in this app
- I could rebuild something similar in a different stack without starting from zero
- I have opinions (with reasoning) about how to structure applications

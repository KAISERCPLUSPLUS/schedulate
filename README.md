# Irregular Task Scheduler

A mobile app for managing tasks that recur at odd intervals (every 5 weeks, twice a year, etc.) and integrating them with Google Calendar.

I'm not sure if anyone else will find it useful and the code quality will probably be embarassing since I've not done a real application before, but hopefully it gives you a laugh.

## AI

I am using Claude Code to help plan, survey different frameworks, document progress, support me with knowledge about React Native etc, but the goal is to do a majority of the coding myself in order to learn.

**Status:** Early development / learning project

## Setup

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npx expo start
```
